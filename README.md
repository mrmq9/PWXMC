# PWXMC
This is the official implementation for the experiments of the unibased loss functions in our paper [Convex Surrogates for Unbiased Loss Functions in Extreme Classification With Missing Labels](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442381.3450139)

To run the experiments using unibased APLC_XLNet [1], AttentionXML [2], and DiSMEC [3], please read the instructions in the corresponding folders.
